## Project Requirement:
***
>> In this project we implemented a class with some methods, but we will did it by doing test-driven development (TDD). The idea is to write tests first and then the code

- Create a class called `Solver`.
- Create a method called `factorial` that takes one argument, an integer `N`, and returns the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) for that number. The factorial is the multiplication of all integers from 1 to `N` and has the special case that the factorial of 0 is 1. This method only accepts 0 and positive integers, so if a negative integer is given it should raise an exception.
- Create a method called `reverse` that takes one argument, a string `word`, and returns `word` reversed (e.g. if `word` is `"hello"` it returns `"olleh"`).
- Create a method called `fizzbuzz` that takes one argument, an integer `N`, and returns a string. The returned string is constructed following these rules:
  - When `N` is divisible by 3, return `"fizz"`.
  - When `N` is divisible by 5, return `"buzz"`.
  - When `N` is divisible by 3 and 5, return `"fizzbuzz"`.
  - Any other case, return `N` as a string (e.g. say `N` is `7` then return `"7"`).
